# PetFeed

Approximately 20 million stray animals live in our country. These animals live
maximum of 3-5 years due to harsh conditions. Under normal conditions, this
period varies between 13-18 years. One of the most important reasons for this
decline in life expectancy is malnutrition and thirst. For this reason, animal lovers
feed the animals living near their homes or go to the feeding areas by establishing
animal feeding groups at certain times.

The feed groups we see on social media only help large, crowded areas. The
reason for this is that the animals in the side streets and parks cannot be
followed.

In FeedPet, users will be able to add locations that can be fed to the map. They
can also add small information notes about this location. In order to avoid the
problem of users going to the same location in the near future, the user chooses
the region to be visited and volunteers to feed at that location between those
hours by choosing one of the time slots determined by the application.

Users can share information about animals in the area. Users can limit the map
or feed information to look at the feeding areas in the area of interest.
According to the circular published by the Ministry of Interior about a year ago,
"Animal Feeding Groups" will be formed, consisting of local governments, public
institutions and organizations and volunteers, according to the regions where
stray animals are found. This means that the animal-loving community will
increase even more.
